            Welcome to the Breaking Bad portion of this webpage! Here we will explore the intricate details of
            Saul's time with Walter and the crew. But first, let me just say that this show is great and if you 
            haven't, then you should 100% check out this show because it is one of the best of all times. The main 
            thing you need to know is that this show is great and you are doing a disservice by not watching it.

            Back to the topic at hand. It is important to realize that Saul is not a bad person. He just makes bad 
            decisions. He tries to do the things that are in his best interest but isnt that like all of us? He does 
            cause harm to those around him, but he also saves Walter numourous times by helping him not get killed by 
            the cartel. He also plays a pivitol character in how he works to make the lives of those around him somewhat
            better by always being prepared. It is a shame what happendd to him at the end because we really see how scared
            he is and how everything spirled way more than he wanted.
