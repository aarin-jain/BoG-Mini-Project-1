            Welcome to the Better Call Saul portion of this webpage! We get a lot of backstory in this plot as we learn
            about what makes James McGill into Saul Goodman. We start off with his odd family dynamic with his parent dead
            and his older brother, Chuck McGill, being a super succesful lawyer. All Jimmy wants to do is be a lawyer like 
            his brother, but his brother doesn't believe in him, relegating him to other tasks at his law firm without ever 
            treating him like an equal. In many ways, this is what sets Jimmy into motion as he is faced with real adversity 
            from his own family.

            Jimmy, still eager to become a lawyer, decides to part ways with his brother and forms his own law firm. He takes on 
            several low profile clients and often finds himself in the local court house where we find Breaking Bad Star Mike playing
            a guard. Here Jimmy takes on pro bono cases that he uses to build a name for himself. Eventually, after a fallout with his
            brother, Chuck dies to a fire, resulting in a distressed Jimmy. In my opinion, this is what finally makes him into Saul Goodman
            as he finally accepts the cruelty of the world and becomes independent, taking risky clients and becoming a criminal mastermind.
