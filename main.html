            Hello! This page is dedicated to the life of Saul Goodman, otherwise known 
            as James Morgan McGill. I hope that you enjoy this as muc as I do and you feel 
            inlcined to follow thhis webpage's journey as we explore the life of one of the 
            greatest lawyers that this generation has seen. It bring me great honor to be able 
            showcase this wonderful work for the betterment of humanity. 
        </p>

            If you look above, there is two pages to explore the apperences that this great lawyer
            stars in. My personal favorite is Breaking Bad as it explores more of the intricate parts of 
            this character and his life journey. Better Call Saul provides a prequel esque feeling that got 
            me exicted and I am hopeful to update this webpage once I finally watch season 6.
